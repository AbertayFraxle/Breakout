# Time Details and Changelist
<Add information to this section about the time you've taken for this task along with a professional changelist.>

1m 37s Identified circular inclusion in PowerupBase.h and PowerupFireBall.h and fixed it

1h 10m Implemented a progress bar to replace the timer when a powerup is active

2h 21m Implemented mouse controls instead of keyboard controls, paddle moves to mouse position at same rate as it moved with keyboard

2h 35m Changed paddle speed from a constant to being editable, with default being constant. Then changed bigPaddle and smallPaddle powerups to effect the movement speed of the paddle

3h 10m Implemented violent screen shake whenever the player loses a life, apart from the last time so screen isnt infinitely shaking
